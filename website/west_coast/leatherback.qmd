As an endangered species, leatherback turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act, which also frequently their consideration in fisheries management plans. Given the ubiquity of this consideration for a number of West Coast fisheries, a number of different species distribution models have been built to predict where these turtles are likely to occur in near-real time. This webpage includes a couple examples of models included in Welch et al (2023) and in Lezama-Ochoa et al (2025) based on two different environmental datasets:
[Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS)](https://marine.copernicus.eu) and [Regional Ocean Modeling System](https://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu/ccsnrt/).

### CMEMS

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Based on one set of selected environmental covariates from CMEMS, this model was used within a set of other SDMs for top predators to determine shifting distributions related to marine heatwaves. Models were fitted using a Boosted Regression Tree and are predicted for the US West Coast. The most recent map product can be found to the right of this text.

### ROMS

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
This model is very similar to that of the other model developed as part of Top Predator Watch, but relies on a slightly different set of environmental variables using a different data assimilative model specific to the US West Coast. The mapped prediction from this model can be seen to the right of this text.
