# DOM Tools 

This webpage contains products from a set of DOM tools that are used to predict the distribution of leatherback turtles (*Dermochelys coriacea*) along the US West Coast. While tools for other species exist, they have not yet been included here. This webpage serves as a proof-of-concept platform to demonstrate how the use of features from GitHub (such as GitHub Actions for operationalization and GitHub pages for website hosting) can be used to deploy and maintain DOM tools using freely available cloud services.
